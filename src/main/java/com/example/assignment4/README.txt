I have implemented all 4 parts and they seem to be working fine.

a few notes form my side:
Paste will paste the blobs on top of the previous blob that was copied. so you would have to move the blob to see if it is pasted.

for redo/undo , if you do these operations after moving blobs , they might seem slow because every small dx, dy increment is being undone or redone.

for multiple selection blobs will only be selected if mouse is relased but cntrl is still down. (since nothing was specified in the Assignment i chose to do this).

Thank you.
